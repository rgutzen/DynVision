DynVision is a modular toolbox for building and evaluating recurrent convolutional neural networks (RCNNs) with biologically plausible temporal dynamics.
The toolbox provides researchers with a framework to explore how details in the network architecture influence temporal dynamics and shape visual processing, while handling most of the overhead to achieve computational efficiently.
The toolbox provides a collection of biologically-inspired components including:

- realistic lateral recurrent connections
- flexible skip and feedback connections
- activity evolution governed by dynamical systems equations
- unrolling of biological time with heterogenous time delays for different connection types
