# Claude Code Guide

> **This file has moved!**
>
> The comprehensive Claude Code guide is now located at:
> **[`docs/development/guides/claude-guide.md`](docs/development/guides/claude-guide.md)**

## Quick Start

For working with DynVision, consult these guides in order:

1. **[AI Style Guide](docs/development/guides/ai-style-guide.md)** - General research software development principles
   - Scientific correctness, reproducibility, performance
   - Approach and workflow (investigate → analyze → implement)
   - Code organization, documentation, testing standards

2. **[Claude Guide](docs/development/guides/claude-guide.md)** - DynVision-specific context
   - Project architecture and design patterns
   - Development commands and workflows
   - Configuration system and conventions
   - Common tasks and known issues

3. **[Developer Guide](docs/development/index.md)** - Complete developer resources
   - Planning documents (TODOs, roadmap)
   - Dependency guides (Snakemake, PyTorch Lightning, FFCV)
   - Software patterns and best practices

## Essential Links

- **README.md**: Project overview, features, quick start
- **[Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md)**: First steps with DynVision
- **[User Guide](docs/user-guide/index.md)**: Task-oriented tutorials
- **[API Reference](docs/reference/index.md)**: Technical documentation

**Why the move?**

The documentation has been reorganized to provide:
- Clear separation between general principles (AI Style Guide) and project specifics (Claude Guide)
- Better organization within the `docs/development/` structure
- Easier maintenance and updates
- More comprehensive coverage of developer resources

The guides are designed to work together: the AI Style Guide establishes best practices for research software development, while the Claude Guide provides the specific context needed for DynVision.
