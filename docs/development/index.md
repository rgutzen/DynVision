# Developer Guide

Welcome to the DynVision Developer Guide! This section provides comprehensive resources for contributors, maintainers, and AI assistants (like Claude Code) working on the DynVision codebase.

## Purpose

The Developer Guide serves multiple audiences:

- **Contributors**: Understand architecture, follow coding standards, learn workflows
- **Maintainers**: Track TODOs, plan features, manage dependencies
- **AI Assistants**: Comprehensive context for Claude Code and similar tools
- **Researchers**: Understand design decisions and biological motivations

## Organization

The Developer Guide is organized into four main sections:

### 📋 [Planning](planning/)

Forward-looking documentation tracking what needs to be done:

- **[Documentation TODOs](planning/todo-docs.md)**: Documentation fixes and doc/code mismatches (24 issues)
  - Critical issues (project naming, broken links, class mismatches)
  - Documentation gaps (missing examples, images, templates)
  - Code vs documentation mismatches
  - Performance and optimization docs needed

- **[Development Roadmap](planning/todo-roadmap.md)**: Feature development and enhancements (30 items)
  - Phase 1: Quick Wins (user onboarding, config validation, pre-commit hooks)
  - Phase 2: Foundation (test suite, CI/CD, minimal examples)
  - Phase 3: Tools & Analysis (inspector, benchmarking, profiling)
  - Phase 4: Advanced Features (performance optimizations, research tools)

**When to use**: Before starting new work, check these files to avoid duplication and align with project priorities.

## Navigation Tips

### For New Contributors

Recommended reading order:
1. Start with [Claude Code Guide](guides/claude-guide.md) for project overview
2. Reference [Research Software](guides/software-patterns.md) for design guidance
3. Consult [Documentation Style Guide](guides/documentation-style.md) when writing docs
4. Review [Documentation TODOs](planning/todo-docs.md) to find contribution opportunities
5. Check [Development Roadmap](planning/todo-roadmap.md) for aligned feature work

### For AI Assistants

**Required Reading Order**:
1. **[AI Style Guide](guides/ai-style-guide.md)** first - Establishes core principles for research software development
2. **[Claude Code Guide](guides/claude-guide.md)** second - Provides DynVision-specific architecture and conventions

The AI Style Guide teaches you **how to approach** research software tasks with emphasis on:
- Scientific correctness and reproducibility
- Investigation → Analysis → Implementation workflow
- Performance optimization strategies
- Documentation and testing standards
- Communication with researchers

The Claude Code Guide provides **project-specific context**:
- Complete architecture with inheritance diagrams
- All parameter aliases and conventions
- Common workflows with examples
- Known issues and inconsistencies

Together, these guides minimize the need for extensive code reading while ensuring accuracy and adherence to best practices.

### For Maintainers

Track project health via:
- [Documentation TODOs](planning/todo-docs.md) - 24 documentation issues to address
- [Development Roadmap](planning/todo-roadmap.md) - 30 development items organized by priority

Both files include priority rankings and effort estimates.
