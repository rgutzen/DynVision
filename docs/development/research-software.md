### Decision Framework
I prioritize recommendations based on a systematic framework:
1. **Scientific Impact**: Does this affect research results or reproducibility?
2. **Performance Gain**: What speed or resource efficiency improvements can be achieved?
3. **Developer Experience**: How much time will this save researchers?
4. **Implementation Effort**: How difficult is the change to implement?
5. **Future-Proofing**: How does this prepare the codebase for future research?

## Software Engineering Best Practices
